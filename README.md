#Rapid Reflex

This game uses a stopclock to measure users' response time to select the correct image displayed on the screen.

Having young grandchildren motivated me to look for fun ways to teach them new skills. This game was initially designed to help them and others learn shapes and colors using a fun computer game. 

When the user clicks the "Start Game" button, the stopclock begins, colored shape images are randomly selected from the array of images and displayed on the screen. A textbox displays words describing one of the two images. The user needs to click the image that matches the description. The description is also randomly selected from the images displayed on the screen.
As soon as the user clicks the image, new images are randomly selected and a new description is randomly displayed.

The game continues until the user loses by clicking the wrong image 3 times, or beats the game by completing all 16 rounds (4 levels) of the game. At the end of the game, the user is told how long they lasted (if they lost 3 lives), or how long it took them to beat the game. Users can compete by attempting to beat the game in the shortest time! 

There are currently 4 levels in the game. Each level lasts for 4 rounds:
  - Level 1 displays 2 beginner images at a time.
  - Level 2 displays 4 beginner images at a time.
  - Level 3 displays 4 more complex images.
  - Level 4 displays images that hopefully interests my Get Coding peeps! :-)

I have been thinking of other levels and skills that can use this game. Variations of the game can teach spelling and math skills.

The project uses javascript, css, and html. 

I am currently adding some animation in the background when the player moves up a level, or finishes the game.
